"""GoodBehavior done-gate — a Stop hook that pushes back on self-declared "done".

When the last assistant message makes an explicit completion claim without support, it blocks the
stop once and feeds back a short self-check. It is a heuristic nudge, not a lie detector: conservative
claim-matching to limit false positives, and a single fire per turn (the stop_hook_active guard
prevents loops).

Two layers:
  LEXICAL    — what the message says. An honest hedge ("not done yet", "unverified") always lets the
               stop through. Verification vocabulary ("verified", "I ran", "tests pass") is only a
               *claim* of proof.
  BEHAVIORAL — what the turn actually did. Verification vocabulary is honored only if something was
               actually run/observed AFTER the last file change this turn (a command, a fetch, a
               browser drive). "Edited files, ran nothing, said 'verified'" blocks: the final state
               of the work was never observed, so the proof-claim is hollow.

False-positive controls, in the order they short-circuit:
  (3) Activity gate  — only arm when THIS turn actually touched code/build (Edit/Write/Bash/...).
                       Pure discussion turns never trip the gate.
  (1) Meta escape    — talking ABOUT the gate/framework ("done-gate", "the hook") isn't a claim.
  (2) Assertive only — the completion word must head a short declarative clause, not just appear
                       somewhere in a long paragraph.
  (0a) Hedge         — an honest downgrade in the message always lets the stop through.
  (0b) Proof+observed — verification vocabulary + an observation after the last change lets it through.
       Doc-only turns (every mutation touched .md/.txt/...) are exempt from the behavioral check:
       there is often nothing to "run" for prose, so proof vocabulary suffices there.

Wire as a Stop hook in .claude/settings.json. Requires only python3.
